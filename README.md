# Stop/Start VMs on Azure using Logic Apps

This procedure use Azure Logic Apps to stop/start VMs on Azure using any schedule. This is an alternative instead of Azure Automation. Also you can use this method for Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD). 

>1. Open **Azure Portal**, click **+ Create a Resource** , type  **Logic App** and press **ENTER**

![img3](/img/img3.png)

>2. At this point you can use an existing **Resource Group** or create a new one. I recommend you to create a test environment before use on production.

>3. Logic App will be created and you can click to configure. On **Templates** section click on **Blank Logic App** to create your first workflow.

>4. Type **Schedule** on **Search** bar

![img6](/img/img6.png)

>5. Click on **Schedule**. The **Trigger** option will appear and then select **Recurrence**.

>6. On **Interval** field type **1**. Select **Week** on **Frequency** field. Use the other options for **Parameters** field:

After selecting all (you don't have to select start time) you can define each one.

- Time zone: based on your location you can define your currently Time Zone. In my case I'm using UTC-03:00 BrasÃ­lia.
- On these days: Define wich day of week this Logic App will work. 
- - If you want to use everyday just change the Frequency parameter to Day (with interval = 1) instead of Week.
- - If you want to setup a different schedule for weekend then you have to create another Logic App with a different schedule (1 Logic app for week days and other for weekends)
- At these hours: select wich hour you want to execute this Logic App. For this test I'm defining the exactly hour (19:00hr) that this Logic app will Stop/deallocate the VMs. 
- At these minutes: just set here if you want a specific minute. Otherwise you can remove this parameter.

After finishing these parameters click on **NEXT** button to choose an action

>7. On **Search** type **Azure VM** and select **Deallocate virtual machine (preview)**

Note: The option **Deallocate** will stop the VM and them will deallocate. You don't need to select the option **Power off virtual machine**. Deallocate will stop incurring costs to your virtual machine.

>8. Select your **Tenant**. Also you have 2 options here and it's very important an short explanation:  

![img10](/img/img10.png)

- Sign in: if you click here this Logic App will be executed based on your credentials. 
- Connect with Service Principal: this option will execute this Logic App using a specific Service Principal and strongly recommended.
- - if you want to create a Service Principal just follow the steps here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal
- - Don't forget to assign permission to allow this Service Principal on the Resource Group to manage virtual machines. You can use the built-in role **Virtual Machine Contributor**

For this lab I'm selecting the option **Sign in** 

>9. Select the parameters for the virtual machine

- Subscription ID
- Resource Group
- Virtual Machine

>Note: Don't worry if you want to add more virtual machines to be stopped. Also you don't need to create 1 Logic App per virtual machine. If you just want to stop/start 1 virtual machine just skip to step 

--------------------



>10. To add more Virtual Machines just click on **+** sign between the **Recurrence** block and **Deallocate virtual machine** block. The pop-up will appear with the option **Insert a next step**. Select the option **Add a parallel branch**

![img12](/img/img12.png)

![img13](/img/img13.png)


Now a new parallel task will open and you can do the same for other virtual machine 


![img14](/img/img14.png)

This step is easy but if you have more than 5 virtual machines to include could be a problem. To avoid this just click on **Save** and then click on **Logic app code view**.

![img15](/img/img15.png)

A JSON format will appear and look at the **actions** section. You will see that the 2 virtual machines created before are listed here. You can copy/paste the lines and just change the line **path**. With this method you can easily add more virtual machines. 

![img16](/img/img16.png)

After adding the virtual machines click on **save** and then click on **designer** to return the previous view.

![img17](/img/img17.png)


>11. Now you can setup the start time. Click on **+ New Step** button, type **SCHEDULE**, click on **Delay Schedule** to add another **Recurrence**. 

![img18](/img/img18.png)

![img19](/img/img19.png)

The tip here is to input X hours after the first **Recurrence** to execute another task. For this test I will use 8 hours. 

![img20](/img/img20.png)

Click on **+ New step** and type **Azure VM**.

![img21](/img/img21.png)

Select **Start virtual machine** option. Now you have to do the same from previous steps when you had added the same virtual machines. Also you can repeat the same steps openning the **Logic app code view** and adding the required virtual machines. 

![img22](/img/img22.png)

Now you can save the Logic App. If you want to test just change the **Step 11** (use 10min for example) and click on **Run** to execute manually. After the tests just remember to change back the paramenters.
